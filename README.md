# KanaFlash
A simple web app to learn Japanese kana (Hiragana &amp; Katakana)

Nothing fancy, just a web UI (made with Sencha Touch) to randomly display one kana at a time with the corresponding romaji.

I made this to help myself with kana memorization. Lots of tools already exist to do this but that's what I wanted.

Feel free to use it, change it or whatever, I'm releasing it in the hope it might help someone else.

See it for yourself:
